## About The Project
This is a clean and simple to-do list web application built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to add, manage, and track their daily tasks directly in the browser. The application uses the browser's local storage to save tasks, ensuring they persist even after the page is reloaded or the browser is closed.

## Features
*   **Add Tasks:** Quickly add new tasks to your list.
*   **Mark as Complete:** Click on a task to mark it as completed, which strikes it through.
*   **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks you no longer need.
*   **Persistent Storage:** Your to-do list is saved in your browser's local storage, so your tasks are not lost when you close the tab.
